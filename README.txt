*** Prototype***

There are 2 basic entities:
1. Laptop.java
2. PC.java

Each of these classes implements Clonable interface and extends Device.java class.

The class DeviceContainer.java keeps a map of Laptop and PC objects. Using identifiers (in this case "id") 
we can create clones of original objects.
